//You have a movie renting company consisting of n shops. You want to implement 
//a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. 
//The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies. 
//
//
// Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where entries[i] = [shopi, 
//moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi 
//with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie 
//moviei. 
//
// The system should support the following functions: 
//
// 
// Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given 
//movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie,
// the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 
//matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented 
//copy, then an empty list should be returned. 
// Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop. 
// Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop. 
// Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) 
//as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the j·µó ∞ cheapest 
//rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in res should be 
//sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the 
//smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the 
//smaller moviej should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all 
//of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an 
//empty list should be returned. 
// 
//
// Implement the MovieRentingSystem class: 
//
// 
// MovieRentingSystem(int n, int[][] entries) Initializes the 
//MovieRentingSystem object with n shops and the movies in entries. 
// List<Integer> search(int movie) Returns a list of shops that have an 
//unrented copy of the given movie as described above. 
// void rent(int shop, int movie) Rents the given movie from the given shop. 
// void drop(int shop, int movie) Drops off a previously rented movie at the 
//given shop. 
// List<List<Integer>> report() Returns a list of cheapest rented movies as 
//described above. 
// 
//
// Note: The test cases will be generated such that rent will only be called if 
//the shop has an unrented copy of the movie, and drop will only be called if the 
//shop had previously rented out the movie. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input
//["MovieRentingSystem", "search", "rent", "rent", "report", "drop", "search"]
//[[3, [[0, 1, 5], [0, 2, 6], [0, 3, 7], [1, 1, 4], [1, 2, 7], [2, 1, 5]]], [1],
// [0, 1], [1, 2], [], [1, 2], [2]]
//Output
//[null, [1, 0, 2], null, null, [[0, 1], [1, 2]], null, [0, 1]]
//
//Explanation
//MovieRentingSystem movieRentingSystem = new MovieRentingSystem(3, [[0, 1, 5], 
//[0, 2, 6], [0, 3, 7], [1, 1, 4], [1, 2, 7], [2, 1, 5]]);
//movieRentingSystem.search(1);  // return [1, 0, 2], Movies of ID 1 are 
//unrented at shops 1, 0, and 2. Shop 1 is cheapest; shop 0 and 2 are the same price, so 
//order by shop number.
//movieRentingSystem.rent(0, 1); // Rent movie 1 from shop 0. Unrented movies 
//at shop 0 are now [2,3].
//movieRentingSystem.rent(1, 2); // Rent movie 2 from shop 1. Unrented movies 
//at shop 1 are now [1].
//movieRentingSystem.report();   // return [[0, 1], [1, 2]]. Movie 1 from shop 0
// is cheapest, followed by movie 2 from shop 1.
//movieRentingSystem.drop(1, 2); // Drop off movie 2 at shop 1. Unrented movies 
//at shop 1 are now [1,2].
//movieRentingSystem.search(2);  // return [0, 1]. Movies of ID 2 are unrented 
//at shops 0 and 1. Shop 0 is cheapest, followed by shop 1.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= n <= 3 * 10‚Åµ 
// 1 <= entries.length <= 10‚Åµ 
// 0 <= shopi < n 
// 1 <= moviei, pricei <= 10‚Å¥ 
// Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei. 
// At most 10‚Åµ calls in total will be made to search, rent, drop and report. 
//
